> In this talk, we'll explore a selection of AI tools that have significantly impacted Alan's work. We'll examine various chatbots, LLMs, integrations with existing apps, and fully AI-based applications. We'll discuss how these tools harness AI to boost productivity, creativity, and problem-solving. He will share personal experiences, demonstrate how he works with these tools, and consider how these AI assistants are shaping our work. Together, we'll sort the Double Deckers from the Fudges... metaphorically speaking, of course. Don't miss this engaging session. Join us at ONE Tech Hub for the last session of 2024!

## Running

If you want to view these slides in the browser, install [python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) and then run the following:

```shell
python -m http.server
```

Alternatively, any other simple web server of your choice should work. For example, [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for NodeJS, which can be run like this...

```shell
npx http-server .
```
